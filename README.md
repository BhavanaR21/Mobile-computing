Mobile Application for Medical Diagnosis Using Ophthalmic Imaging

Mobile phones are increasingly being employed in the different steps of provision of healthcare. Such smartphone applications are effectively replacing expensive diagnosis tools and equipment in the preliminary examination for a variety of health conditions. A large number of health issues, both urgent ones such as stroke, aneurysm and cancer as well as long term conditions like anemia, glaucoma, arthritis and Parkinson’s disease can be detected through a comprehensive eye examination, in particular, of the pupil, the retina and the cornea. Further, the overall state of a person’s health, i.e., nutritional deficiencies, the prospect of high cholesterol or diabetes and possible allergies can also be identified through an eye analysis. In our work, we aim to develop a smartphone application through which ophthalmic imaging of eyes is performed, this image data is examined through deep learning and rule based systems and possible initial diagnosis is reported.
